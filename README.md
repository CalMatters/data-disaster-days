## Data Dictionary

Assuming a json, csv or GSheet data source, document each field and describe that the field is conveying, including any additional context that helps someone using this data understand pitfalls, cavaets and any other issues. Below is an example from Erica's [release](https://github.com/CalMatters/ev-zipcode-demographics-data) of her analysis of EV ownership data.

        <p>ZIP code. Only ZIP codes with 2021 American Community Survey population data and at least 1,000 residents are
          included. Used by the postal service, ZIP codes do not have exact persistent geographical boundaries. The
          demographic data here comes from the Census Bureau's Zip Code Tabulation Areas, which are approximated by
          addresses.</p>
